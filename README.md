### W8-Project
Week 8 project during DevMountain coding bootcamp, for this particular project, we had 1 1/2 days of coding available.

##### My Movie Library
I wanted my kids to have a visual library of movies we've watched together, so we'd spend less time on what to pick next, then I started coding!

##### Description
My Movie Library is an app where you can add movies you've watched for easy referencing.

On this app, you're greeted with a form that lets you add a movie name, the date it was released, and the image URL.

Once added, the watched movie will appear on the right side as a new movie card.

##### Getting Started
###### Dependencies
It was build using node.js and express, listed on package.json.

###### Installing
1. Clone the repo above and within the folder you chose run the following command in the terminal: 
	1. `node index.js` - pointing to the index.js server file
2. Port 4004 will be open to run the backend
3. Open the client's index.html file with live server
4. Open the app using your localhost/browser
5. Ready! Now just add the movie and hit "Go!"
